### Thesis chatGPT powered ETH transactions

AI is poised to take full advantage of crypto.  AI agents won't have bank accounts - [they will have crypto wallets](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2023-06-09/what-s-the-best-use-for-crypto-ai-will-figure-it-out).  This app is a simple implementation of using chatGPT to send transactions, but could easily be extended to any type of on-chain activity, and then further extended to use in an autonomous agent.

#### Running the code:
You will need to run ganache locally on port 8545 (`npm install ganache --global`) and run it with `ganache`.

Then run the app with `yarn run dev` (after `yarn install`).  I included a screen recording of the functionality.



You will also need an openAI api key to save in the project's .env as `OPENAI_API_KEY`. 

I built this app in a short amount of time (as per the instructions) and would love to expand on it.
